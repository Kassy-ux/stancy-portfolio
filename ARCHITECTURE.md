# Architecture

This document describes how the portfolio system is structured, how data flows through it, and the reasoning behind key design decisions.

---

## System Overview

The project is a two-app monorepo. The `client/` and `server/` folders each have their own `package.json` and are developed and deployed independently.

```
browser
  |
  |-- HTTP GET (static assets, JS bundle)
  |                    |
  |           Vite dev server (port 5173)
  |           OR static file host (production)
  |
  |-- API calls to /api/*
  |                    |
  |           Vite proxy  ─────────────────────────> Express server (port 5000)
  |           (dev only)                                      |
  |                                                  Drizzle ORM
  |                                                           |
  |                                                  Neon PostgreSQL
  |
  |-- Image/file uploads (via Express, streamed to Cloudinary)
```

In production, the Vite proxy is replaced by the deployment platform's reverse proxy or CORS policy. The Express API is deployed to a Node.js host, and the built client is deployed to a static host.

```

## Data Flow: Public Portfolio

When a visitor opens the site, TanStack Query fetches each section's data independently.

```
Home.tsx
  |
  +-- useQuery(['settings'])        -> GET /api/settings    -> siteSettingsTable
  +-- useQuery(['projects'])        -> GET /api/projects    -> projectsTable
  +-- useQuery(['skills'])          -> GET /api/skills      -> skillsTable
  +-- useQuery(['experience'])      -> GET /api/experience  -> experienceTable
  +-- useQuery(['education'])       -> GET /api/education   -> educationTable
  +-- useQuery(['testimonials'])    -> GET /api/testimonials -> testimonialsTable
  +-- useQuery(['community'])       -> GET /api/communities  -> communityTable
```

Each query is independent. If one fails or the server is slow, the others are unaffected. Every section component accepts a `fallbackData` prop so static placeholder content is shown while the query loads.

---

## Data Flow: Admin Panel

The admin panel is a single-page application mounted under `/admin/dashboard`. It is protected by a route guard in `router.ts` that checks for a valid JWT in `localStorage`.

```
Dashboard.tsx
  |
  +-- <ProjectsPanel>  useMutation -> POST/PUT/DELETE /api/projects
  +-- <SkillsPanel>    useMutation -> POST/PUT/DELETE /api/skills
  +-- <SettingsPanel>  useMutation -> PUT             /api/settings
  +-- ...
```

All mutations in `adminApi.ts` attach the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The token is written to `localStorage` under the key `admin_token` on successful login and removed on logout.

---

## Authentication

```
POST /api/auth/login
  body: { email, password }
        |
        |-- bcryptjs.compare(password, storedHash)
        |
        |-- jwt.sign({ userId, email }, JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '7d' })
        |
        response: { token }

client stores token in localStorage['admin_token']

subsequent admin requests:
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
        |
  authenticate middleware
        |
        |-- jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET)
        |-- attaches req.user = { userId, email }
        |-- calls next()
        |   OR returns 401 if invalid/expired
```

The `authenticate` middleware in `server/src/Middleware/auth.ts` is applied to every protected route. Public GET routes do not require a token.

---

## Settings System

Personal details and site configuration are stored in a single key-value table:

```sql
siteSettingsTable: { key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT }
```

This avoids adding columns every time a new setting is needed. The service layer reduces all rows into a plain object at read time:

```ts
// getAllSettings (simplified)
const rows = await db.select().from(siteSettingsTable);
return rows.reduce((acc, row) => ({ ...acc, [row.key]: row.value }), {});
```

On write, each key-value pair is upserted independently. The current settings keys are:

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `tagline` | Hero section sub-heading |
| `heroImageUrl` | Hero profile image (Cloudinary URL) |
| `heroFocalPoint` | Focal point for hero image as `"x,y"` (0–100 range) |
| `resumeUrl` | Downloadable resume (Cloudinary URL) |
| `githubUrl` | GitHub profile link |
| `linkedinUrl` | LinkedIn profile link |
| `twitterUrl` | Twitter/X profile link |
| `email` | Contact section email |
| `phone` | Contact section phone |
| `location` | Contact section location text |
| `aboutBio` | About section long-form bio |

---

## File Upload Pipeline

All file uploads (images, PDFs) follow the same path:

```
client FormData POST
        |
  multer middleware (server)
        |-- storage: memoryStorage (file is held in req.file.buffer)
        |-- limits: 5 MB
        |
  uploadToCloudinary helper
        |-- opens a Cloudinary upload stream
        |-- pipes req.file.buffer through the stream
        |-- resolves with { secure_url, public_id }
        |
  controller saves secure_url to the database
        |
  response: { url: secure_url }
```

Files are never written to disk on the server. The buffer is streamed directly to Cloudinary. This keeps the server stateless and compatible with platforms that have ephemeral filesystems.

---

## Frontend Rendering Pattern

Each section component follows the same pattern:

```ts
// 1. Fetch data
const { data } = useQuery({ queryKey: ['skills'], queryFn: api.skills.getAll });

// 2. Fall back to static placeholder if query hasn't resolved
const skills = data ?? fallbackSkills;

// 3. Render
return <section>...</section>;
```

This means the page is never empty — placeholder data is visible immediately, and then replaced when the API responds. The same pattern is used in all nine sections.

---

## Routing

TanStack Router manages three routes:

| Route | Component | Access |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `/` | `Home.tsx` | Public |
| `/admin/login` | `Login.tsx` | Public |
| `/admin/dashboard` | `Dashboard.tsx` | Protected (redirect to login if no token) |

Navigation on the home page is scroll-based. `DotNavigation` uses the `useActiveSection` hook, which attaches an `IntersectionObserver` to each section's element and updates a shared state as sections enter and leave the viewport.

---

## Three.js Hero Background

`HeroBackground.tsx` renders a full-screen WebGL canvas behind the hero section using React Three Fiber. It renders animated, semi-transparent geometric shapes. The component is purely visual and has no data dependencies. If WebGL is unavailable it renders nothing and the hero section falls back to its CSS background.

---
